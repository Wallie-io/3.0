# Wallie 3.0

**A local-first social network where you own your data.**

Wallie is a peer-to-peer social platform built on the principle that your data belongs to you. By storing data locally in your browser and syncing directly with peers, Wallie eliminates the need for centralized servers while giving you complete control over your social graph, messages, and content.

## Mission

**Empower users with true data ownership and digital sovereignty.**

We believe social networks should be resilient, private, and user-controlled. Wallie achieves this by:

- **Local-First Architecture** - Your data lives in your browser, accessible offline
- **Peer-to-Peer Sync** - Connect directly with friends without intermediaries
- **End-to-End Encryption** - Private messages stay private
- **Immutable Identity** - Decentralized profiles stored on Arweave
- **Zero Vendor Lock-In** - Export your data anytime, run your own node

## What Wallie Does

- **Social Feed** - Share updates, photos, and thoughts with your network
- **Private Messaging** - End-to-end encrypted conversations
- **Communities** - Create and join interest-based groups with your peers
- **Hangouts/Huddles** - Audio-only and video live sessions with friends and communities
- **Local Data Control** - All content stored in your browser's local database
- **Offline-First** - Use Wallie without an internet connection
- **Peer Discovery** - Find and connect with friends through distributed protocols
- **Profile Permanence** - Your identity lives on Arweave, immune to deplatforming

## Technology Stack

- **React Router v7** - Type-safe routing with server/client loaders and actions
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Modern, utility-first styling with custom Wallie theme

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Session secret (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Always generate a unique `SESSION_SECRET` for each environment.

### Type Checking

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```
